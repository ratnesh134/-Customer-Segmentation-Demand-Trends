# 📌 Customer Segmentation & Demand Patterns Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** and **demand trend analysis** using **Python**. The goal is to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior and identify peak demand periods to optimize business strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Segment customers into **High-Value, Frequent, and Occasional buyers** using **K-Means clustering**.
- Analyze sales trends to detect **peak ordering periods**.
- Visualize customer segments and order patterns using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses two datasets:
1. **customers.csv** – Contains customer information, including total spend and order frequency.
2. **sales_data.csv** – Contains order details, including order dates, revenue, and product categories.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation & preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – K-Means clustering

## 🚀 Implementation
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Load datasets and handle missing values.
- Convert date columns to **datetime format**.
- Standardize numerical features for clustering.

### 2️⃣ Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)
- Extract **total spend** and **number of orders** as key features.
- Apply **K-Means clustering** to segment customers.
- Label clusters: **High-Value, Frequent, Occasional buyers**.

### 3️⃣ Demand Trends Analysis
- Group sales data by **monthly and weekly periods**.
- Identify **peak periods** where revenue and orders exceed 1 standard deviation above the mean.
- Visualize revenue and order trends with **line charts & bar plots**.

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Customer Segmentation Scatter Plot**: Total spend vs. Order frequency
- **Monthly Revenue Trends**: Highlighting peak sales periods
- **Revenue by Product Category**: Understanding which products generate the most revenue
- **Orders by Region**: Identifying strong market areas

## 📈 Business Insights
🔹 **High-Value customers** should receive personalized offers and premium services.  
🔹 **Frequent buyers** are ideal for **loyalty programs** to increase order value.  
🔹 **Peak ordering periods** indicate when to optimize marketing campaigns and inventory management.

## 📦 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python Customer_Segmentation.py
   ```

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implementing **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for better segmentation.
- Using **Time Series Forecasting** to predict future demand trends.
- Enhancing **dashboard visualizations** for real-time business insights.
